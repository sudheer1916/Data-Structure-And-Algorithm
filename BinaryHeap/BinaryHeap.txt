Binary Heap 
-> used to implement heapsort.
-> used mainly to implement Priority queue
Priority Queue are useful in many standard Algorithms like :-
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimam spanning tree algorithm, hoffman coding.
Most of the time, Priority queue is implemented using heap data structer
MinHeap :- highest Priority item is assigned to lowest value
MaxHeap :- highest Priority item is assigned to highest value

Binary Heap is a complete Binary Tree(i.e no gaps b/w the tree)
because it is stored as an array
left(i) = 2i+1
right(i) = 2i+2
parent(i) = floor((i-1)/2)

MinHeap :- 
-> complete Binary tree
-> Every node has value smaller than its descendants.
-> pictorial representation :- Binary tree but,
   actual representation is an array.
