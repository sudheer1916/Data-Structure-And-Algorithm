->string in java uses utp-16 and 16 bits to store whereas,
  in cpp, used ascii value and 8 bits to store.
->in cpp,we cannnot do cin>>"sudheer kumar"  //it takes only sudheer
  sol for this prblm, we use getLine(cin,"sudheer kumar");
->in java string class is by default "immutable".
  i.e once created String str = "geeks"; //this cannnot be modified
  if we want to modify, we have two mutable classes :-
  StringBuffer :- thread safe class,we can use in multi-threaded 
  StringBuilder:- not thread safe, used within the thread.
->pattern searching:-   1 <= m <= naive
  where, m -> pattern length , n -> txt length
  1)naive method:-      //no preprocessing
  for distinct elements :- O(n)   //improved naive method
  for not distinct elements :- O((n-m+1)*m)
  2) rabin karp algo :- O((n-m+1)*m)    //preprocessing pattern
     rolling hash :- where we can compute the next hash using previous 
                     hash in constant time.
     rolling function :- t(i+1) = d(t(i) - t*t[i]*d^(m-1)) + t*t[i+m]
                            //m -> length of pattern
  3) KMP :- O(n)    //preprocessing pattern
  4) suffix tree :- O(m)        //preprocessing text
